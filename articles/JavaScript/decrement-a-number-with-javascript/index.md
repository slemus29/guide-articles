title: Decrement A Number with javaScript
---
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by `1` with the `--` operator.

    i--;

is the equivalent of

    i = i - 1;

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

There is a way of doing the same thing but with a slight difference 

    ```javascript
    --i;
    ```
The result here is the same decrement but the value return by the expression is the new value, with `i++` the returning value of the expression is the one before the change.
